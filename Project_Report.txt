Final AI Project Report:

This AI is a "smart" agent. It keeps a record of tiles it has visited and tiles that are possibly/definitely dangerous. It uses this information to make
sure that it never dies. The agent is a very timid agent. It takes no risks - if there is even a slight chance of dying it will not go towards
a tile. If it perceives a dangerous percept on the starting tile it will just exit the cave. If the agent discovers a stench, it will try to shoot
its arrow if it hasn’t already. If it then perceives a scream, it will un-mark all tiles that were marked unsafe due to a stench. 

Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement a proper search algorithm for the agent so it doesn't score as high as I would like.
It moves to tiles it has never seen before in a random fashion. If it lands on a tile with a dangerous percept, it turns around to the previous
tile and tries to visit an unvisited but safe tile. This continues until it either finds the gold or goes over 100 turns. In either case
the agent will back-track to the start and exit the cave. The back-tracking algorithm is simple: push every tile the agent visits onto a stack.
Once it decides it wants to back track, go to the tile on the top of the stack (by turning right until it is facing that tile). As a fail safe,
if the agent goes over a certain amount of turns and the back-tracking function fails somehow (this never occurred in the 4000+ trials the
agent has ran on), the agent will just start moving randomly until it dies.

To see the agent in action, navigate to Wumpus_World_cpp_shell/bin in terminal and type “./MyAI”. Select the desired world size (4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 is optimal) and press enter to see the agent perform turn-by-turn.


I have implemented private helper functions for the agent. They include:

RandomMove: a function that just makes a random move (the code from the randomAI was basically recycled for this). 

aboutFace: a function that makes the agent turn around and move to the previous tile  (this is accomplished by turning right twice and moving forward). 

checkIfInArray: Checks if a tile the agent wants to move on is in the visited or unsafe array

markSurroundingTilesUnsafeStench: Marks surrounding tiles as unsafe due to stench - the agent will then never move to these tiles unless the Wumpus is killed

markSurroundingTilesUnsafeBreeze: Marks surrounding tiles as unsafe due to breeze - the agent will then never move to these tiles

getNextMove: returns the tile the agent would be on if it moved forward 

backTrack: Contains the back-tracking algorithm that allows the agent to exit the cave safely

markTileBreeze: Marks tile as having a breeze

markTileStench: marks tile as having a stench


With these functions and the logic behind the agent's actions, it is able to always avoid death. The agent successfully captures the gold in most
caves it is able to (because it is a very timid agent it sometimes fails to grab the gold when it would be possible to because it would have to walk
through a tile that was not known to be safe). I am pleased with this agent and am confident that it will perform well in the tournament.
